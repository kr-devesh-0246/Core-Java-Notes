# Abstract Classes
We know well what a class is. The rule is that any thing is written in the class, it is available as it is to all the class objects.
```java 
class Myclass {
    // Method to calculate the square value
    void calculate(double x){
        sout("Square= "+(x*x));
    }
}
Class Common {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Myclass obj1 = new Myclass();
        Myclass obj2 = new Myclass();
        Myclass obj3 = new Myclass();

        // call calculate method from the objects
        obj1.calculate(1);
        obj1.calculate(2);
        obj1.calculate(3);
    }
}
```

```cmd
~ javac Common.java
~ java Common
  Square= 1
  Square= 4
  Square= 9
```
In the preceding program, the requirement of all the objects is same but sometimes the requirement of the object will depend entirely on the specific object only. 
Let's say we want only a single method called calculate to do three different operations for three objects. 

To serve each object with the one and only one calculate() method in Myclass, we can follow these steps:
1. Create calculate() method in Myclass.
2. We dont write the body of the calculate method, it will become commmonly available to all objects. So we dont write the body of the method. Which is called abstract method. And the class will become abstract class.
3. Now derive a sub class Sub1 from Myclass, so that the calculate() method is available to the subclass. Now, provide the body of the calculate method in Sub1 such that it calculates to the obj1's requirement. Similarly for further subclasses. 
4. It is possible to create objects for the sub classes. Using which repective methods can be called and used.

## Abstract Method and Abstract Classes
An abstract method does not contain any body. It contains only the method header. A class containing an abstract method is called Abstract class. Both of them are declared using **abstract** keyword.

***Q. Why dont JVM lets object of a abstract class be created?***

***A.*** Since, abstract class contain incomplete methods, it is not possible to estimate the total memory required to create the object.

```java
abstract class Myclass {
    abstract void calculate(double x);
}
class Sub1 extends Myclass {
    void calculate(double x) {
        sout("Square: "+(x*x));
    }
}
class Sub2 extends Myclass {
    void calculate(double x) {
        sout("Square root: "+Math.sqrt(x));
    }
}
class Sub3 extends Myclass {
    void calculate(double x) {
        sout("Cube: "+(x*x*x));
    }   
}
class Different {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Sub1 obj1 = new Sub1();
        Sub2 obj2 = new Sub2();
        Sub3 obj3 = new Sub3();

        obj1.calculate(2);
        obj2.calculate(4);
        obj3.calculate(4);
    }
}
```
```cmd
javac Different.java
java Different
Square= 4
Square root= 2
Cube= 64
```
**Important Note**
We know we cant create objects of abstract class but we can create a reference variable to it, as this variable will not take any memory(We meant for main memory, it does not take memory).
```java
Myclass ref;      // ref is the reference of Myclass
ref = obj1;       // ref is referring to obj1
ref.calculate(3);   // call obj1's calculate method
ref = obj1;
ref.calculate(4);
ref = obj1;
ref.calculate(5);
```
