# Chapter 4: Naming conventions and Data types

## Naming conventions in Java
Naming conventions specifies the rules to be followed by a Java programmer while writing the names of packages, methods, etc. 

**Package-** A package represents a sub directory that contains a group of classes and interfaces. 
Package_names - small letters only.
```java
java.awt
java.io
javax.swing
```

**Class-** Each word of a class name starts with a capital letter.
```java 
String
DataInputStream
```
**method-** First letter of method name in small letter. And onwards each new word with a capital letter 
```java
println()
readLine()
getNumberInstance()
```

**variable-** Same as the method.
```java
age
empName
emp_Desgn
```

**Q. If both methods and variables share same naming conventions how we distinguish between them?**

***Ans*** The method name ends with () braces whereas variables dont.

**Constants-** It represents fixed values that can't be altered. 
They are written using all capital letters.
```java
PI
MAX_VALUE
Font.BOLD
```
Note- BOLD is a constant in the font class and this is the way most inbuilt constants in Java are referenced. 

**Keywords-** All the keywords are written using small letters.
```java
public
static 
void 
```



## Data Types in Java
We know we need variables to store data. A variable represents a memory location which hold the data. 

Say that
```java
int x;
```
here we declared x as a variable, which can store int type data. This means int represents the nature of data to be stored into x. That's why int is also called a data type. 

For example, x can store an integer number like 125 as: 
```java
x = 125;
```
Here, x is a variable and = represents that the value 125 is stored into x. This value is also called literal.

And there are various types of both of these data types and literals. 

### Integer Data Types
Note- From now on think technically, data types != data type. Integer and Float Data Types are not just int and float data type. They are a group of data types. Maybe that's why Integer != int.

These data types represent integer numbers. For example, 125, -225678, 0, 1022 come under this category. Integer data types are again sub divided into byte, short, int and long types. 

<!-- Tables -->
| Data type      | Memory size |Min and Max values|
| --------- | ----------------- |--------------|
|```byte```     | 1 byte              |-128 to +127|
|```short```    | 2 bytes             |-32768 to +32767|
|```int```      | 4 bytes             |-2147483648 to +2147483647|
|```long```     | 8 bytes             |-9223372036854775808  to +9223372036854775807|

Let's take an example
```java
byte rno = 10;
```
here byte represents any value between -128 to +127.
```java
long x = 150L;
```
Here 150 is followed by L at the end of statement. If this L is not there, then JVM allots only 2 bytes of memory to x. The reason is that 2 bytes are sufficient to store the value 150.

### Float Data Types
These are useful to represent numbers with decimal point. For example, 3.14, 0.025 are called floating point numbers. These are again classified into float(single precision floating point number) and double(double precision floating point number). The difference exists in the number of digits, they can represent after the decimal point. 
|Data type    |Memory size    |Min and max values   | 
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
|```float```        |4 bytes        |dont waste time      |
|```double```       |8 bytes        |dont waste time      |

***Q. What is the difference between float and double?***

*Ans.* float can represent up to a precision of 7 digits accurately after decimal point, whereas double can represent up to 15 digits.

Let's take an example
```java
float pi = 3.14;
```
If F is not at the end of the statement. Then, JVM by default treats it as a double. And allocate 8 bytes of memory to pi variable. 

Doubt- If JVM can save memory then why not doing so?
### Character Data Type
This represents a single character like a, P, *, etc.
|Data Type|Memory size|Min and max values|
|---------|-----------|------------------|
|char     |2 bytes    |0 to 65535        |

Let's take an example
```java
char ch='X';
```
We are storing a single character 'X' into the variable ch. X is also called a character literal. Whenvever character literals are written, they are enclosed inside a single quote.

One more point is: The range of this data type is non-negative. Each characters on the keyboard are translated uniquely into integer values called ASCII. Currently there are only 256 ASCII characters. It can be stored in 1 byte memory size.

***Q.*** If the english charectars on the keyboard do not exceed 256. Then why char has 65536 distinct charectars to be reserved?

***A.*** Yes, the typical keyboard containing english characters can be satistfied within 256 figure but Javasoft team wanted to include characters not only from English but all other human languages. This enable programmers to write and execute a java program to write and execute in any language, which became an advantage on Internet. 

Note- This system is also called Unicode system which uses 2 bytes so that any character from any language can be encoded successfully.

***Q.***What is a Unicode system?

***A.*** Unicode system is a encoding standard that providea unique number for every character, no matter what the platform, program, or language is. Unicode uses 2 bytes to represent a single character.

Doubt- The unicode doesnot seems to be of 2 bytes? What is that?

### String Data Type
A String represents a group of characters. 
```java
String str = "New Delhi";
```
String type variable str contains "New Delhi". String should be enclosed within double quotes. 

There is a class String in java, where several methods are defined. Any string is considered as an object of String class. 

In c/c++, a string is considered as a character array ending with '\0'. This is not in Java. Here string and character arrays are seperate. 
 
Note that In java every class is a data type. Thus, String class is also a data type.

### Boolean Data Type
It represents either true or false. JVM uses 1 bit to represent a boolean values internally. We should not enclose the boolean value in any quotation mark.

For example:
```java 
boolean response=true;
```

## Literals 
A literal is a value that is stored directly into a variable in a program. 

For example
```java
boolean result = false;
int i = -100;
char gender = 'M';
short s = 10000;
```
In the above example, all the right hand terms are called literals because they are stored in the variables shown at their ledt hand side.

As the data type of a variable changes, the type of literal also changes. 

The different types of literals are:
* Integer literals
* Float literals
* Character literals
* String literals
* Boolean literals
* Binary literals

#### Integer literals
Represent the fixed length integer values like 100, -40, etc. All these numbers belong to decimal system. 

Suppose, integer is in Octal number system(uses 8 digits) we should prefix 0 before the number.

To represent hexadecimal number we should use prefix 0x before the value.
```java
int decVal = 26;
int octVal = O29;
int hexVal = Ox33;
```
Doubt- Is it O or 0?

#### Float literals
Represents fractional numbers which should use float or double type variables. While writting these, we can use e or E for scientific notation, F or f for float literal, and D or d for double literal(default and generally omitted).

For example
```java
float f1 = 123.45f;
double d1 = 123.4;
double d2 = 1.234e2;
```
Doubt - What is the use of e or E notation?
#### Character literals
Character literals indicate the following:
* General characters like A, b, 9
* Special characters like ?, @
* Unicode characters like \u0042(a in ISO Latin 1 character set)
* Escape sequence(backslace codes) like \n, \b
Character literals should be enclode in single quotation marks.
Unicode and Escape sequnce can also be within double quotation.

#### String Literals
Represents the objects of String class.

#### Boolean Literals
It represents two values only- true or false. 

#### Binary Literals
A binary literal can be represented with prefix 0b or 0B and represents a number in binary system, as:
```java
int num = 0b1101;          // this is a binary value
short num = (short)0b1101; // binary value is converted into short
```
By default, literal values are considered as integers. This is the reason that binary value is converted into short type using cast operator before it's stored into short type variable.

```java
//display a binary number in other number systems
class Binary7 
{
    psvm(String args[])
    {
        int num = 0b1010; //binary

        sout("\nIn Decimal = %d", num);
        sout("\nIn Octal = %o", num);
        sout("\nIn Hexadecimal = %x", num);
        sout("\nIn Binary = %s", Integer.toBinaryString(num));
    }
}
```
### Using Underscore in Numeric Literals
To improve readability, underscore can be used in numeric literals. 
```java
byte b = (byte)0b01011_10;
int x = 0B1010_1100_0110;
int num = 10_00_000;
float y = 13.14_15_92f;
```
