# Operators in Java
An operator is symbol that performs an operation. An operator acts on some variable, called operands to get the desired result.

Unary, Binary and Tertiary operator acts on a single, two, and three variables(operand) resp.

There are a few types of Operators: 
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
These are used to perform fundamental operations like addition and subtraction. There are 5 arithmetic operators in Java. 
And since they act on two operands at a time they are *binary operators*. 
a+b, a-b, a/b, a*b, a%b are the 5 types of arithmetic operators.

Note- The Addition operator is also used to join two strings.
```java
String s1 = "Wel";
String s2 = "come";
String s3 = s1+s2;
// We get "Welcome" stored in s3 and in this case, + is called *String concatenation operator*
```
## 2. Unary Operators
There are 3 kinds of unary operators:
* Unary Minus Operator
* Increment Operator
* Decrement Operator

### 1.Unary Minus Operator(-)
This is used to negate a given value.
```java
int x = 5;
System.out.println(-x);
System.out.println(-(-x));

```
### 2. Increment Operator(++)
This operator increases the value of a variable by 1. 
```java
int x = 1;
++x; // will make 2
x++; // will make 3
//Doubt- How is it 3. It should be 2 then 3.
```
Pre-increment: Here the value is first incremented then printed 
```java
int x;
++x;
```

Post-increment: Here the value is first printed and then it is incremented
```java
int x;
x++;
```
### 3. Decrement Operator(--)
This operator decreases the value of a variable by 1. 
```java
int x = 1;
--x;
x--;
```
### 4. Assignment Operator(=)
This Operator is used to store some value into a variable. It can be used in 3 ways:
1. To store a value into a variable
```java
int x = 5;
```
2. To store the value of a variable into another variable
```java
int x = y;
```
3. To store the value of an expression into a variable
```java
int x = y+z-1;
```
Note: -
We can't do:
1. keep more than one variable at the left hand side of the = operator.
2. We can't use literal or constant value on the left hand side of = operator.

### Compact Notation
```java 
// Addition assignment operator
x = x+1; // Expanded notation 
x += 1;  // Compact notation

// Multiplication assignment operator
y = y * 2;
y *= 2;

// Subtraction assignment operator
z = z-1;
z -= 1;

// Division assignment operator
p = p/10;
p /= 10;

// Modulus assignment operator
num = num%2;
num %= 2;
```

### Relational Operator
These are used for the purpose of comparing. These are of 6 types: 

1. Greater than operator(>)
2. Greater than or equal to(>=)
3. Less than operator(<)
4. Less than or equal to(<=)
5. Equal to operator(=)
6. not equal to operator(!=)

These are mainly used in the construction of conditions in statement, like in for loop, if else conditionals.

### Logical Operator
Logical operators are used to construct compound conditions. These are of 3 types:
1. && and operator
2. || or operator
3. ! not operator

```java 
if(a==1||b==2||c==3) sout("Yes");          // or operator 
if(x>y && y<z) sout("Hello");              // and operator
if(!(str1.equals(str2))) sout("Not equal); // not operator
```

### Boolean Operator
They are similar to Logical operators but the only difference is these deals on boolean type values whereas previous one dealt with general inputs.
These operators act on boolean values and produce boolean type result. There are 2 types:
1. & boolean and operator
2. | boolean or operator
3. ! boolean not operator

```java
// compute mentally each one of them.
boolean a,b;
a = true; 
b = false;
a & b
a | b
a & a
b | b
!a
!b
```
