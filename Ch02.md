# Chapter 2: Introduction to Java

## Java's development and timeline
**In 1990, at Sun Microsystems(US)**: Concieved a project to develop software for consumer electronic devices that could be controlled by remote. This was the soul aim. Not to make Java only.

This was named "Stealth Project". Later renamed to "Green Project".

**In 1991, at Colorado**: Meeting of Bill Joy, James Gosling, Mike Sheradin, Patrick Naughton, and several others to discuss the project. 
Mike- Business Model
Patrick- Graphic System
Gosling- Identify proper programming language for the project
Gosling earlier thought C/C++ but they were system dependent.
Gosling started developing a system independent language(new Programming language).
It was named Oak, later renamed to Java.

**Oak**: Named after an Oak tree that used to stand before the company office.

**Java**: They wanted to emphasize the role of Coffee during the development phase. The best one comes from Java islands. 

**In 1994**: Patrick and Jonathan Payne started writing WebRunner.
WebRunner was a Java based Web browser, Once stable it was demonstrated to the Sun executives. Renamed to HotJava. HotJava was the first Web browser, able to execute applets. 
applets- programs designed to run dynamically on Internet.
All of these helped realising Java's potential in World Wide Web.

**In 1995, @SunWorld_Conference**: Both Java and HotJava were launched
->Netscape Inc. incorporated Java Support in Netscape Navigator(Browser)
->Microsoft agreed to support Java on Internet Explorer.

**On 23 Jan 1996**: JDK 1.0 was released.

## Features of Java
Apart from system independence
* **Simple**: It is not a feature, it is the design aim of Java. Since it was to work on electronic device, with small available memory.

    a. Difficult and ambiguous concepts of C/C++ has been completely omitted.

    b. JavaSoft team kept its syntax same as of C/C++ for simplicity.

**Q.Why pointers are eliminated in Java?**

***Ans*** There are reasons:
    1. Pointers lead to confusion for a programmer
    2. It may crash a program easily
    3. It may break security. Using it harmful programs can be developed

* **Object-Oriented**: Java is an Object-Oriented Prog Lang.
**Object**- Anything that really exists in the world and can be  distinguished from others. It has both attributes and properties
**Class**- Named group for a group of several objects. 
*Note:- Both class and object are almost the same with the difference that a class is only logically defined whereas object does physically exist*

**Q. What is the difference between a function and a method?**

***Ans***. A method is function that is written inside a class. In Java, only methods are there. In C/C++ we can write function both inside and outside the class. Hence they are called member functions and not methods.

* **Distributed**: Information is distributed on various computers on a network. Using Java, we can write programs, which capture information and distribute it to the clients. This is done using TCP/IP and UDP protocols 

<!-- Later briefly describe both the points -->
* **Robust**: Robust means **strong** and they **do not crash easily** like c/c++. There are 2 main reasons

    *1. Exceptions handling*

    *2. Memory management feature(Java Garbage Collector)*

**Q. Which algorithm is used by garbage collector to remove the unused variables or objects from memory?**

***Ans***. GC uses many alogrithms but most common is **"Mark and Sweep algorithm"**.

**Q. How can you call the GC?**

***Ans***. Garbage collector is automatically invoked when program is run. It can manually be called using gc() method of Runtime class or System class in Java.

* **Secure**: All the four threats(eavesdropping, tampering, impersonation, and virus) can be eliminated or minimised using Java on Internet.

* **System** Independence: Java's bytecode is not machine dependent. 

* **Portability**: If a program yields the same result on every machine, then that program is called portable. Java programs are portable.

* **High performance**: The problem with interpreter inside the JVM is that it is slow, due to this, Java used to be slow. JavaSoft people introduced JIT compiler, which enhances the speed. So now in JVM, both interpreter and JIT compiler work together to run the program.

* **Multithreaded**: A thread represents an individual process to execute a group of statements. JVM uses several threads to execute different blocks of code. Creating multiple threads is possible in Java.

* **Scalability**: Java platform can be implemented on a wide range of computers with varying level of resources because of it is compact and platform independent.

* **Dynamic**: Before java, only static text used to be displayed in the browser. But Gosling demonstrated an animated atomic molecule using an applet program, which are the dynamically interacting programs on Internet.

## The Java Virtual Machine
It is the heart of program execution process. It takes the .class file and converts each byte code instruction into machine language instruction that can be executed by the microprocessor. 

First the .java is converted into .class file by java compiler. This .class file is given to the JVM. In JVM, there is a module(program) called class loader sub system, which does the following functions:

<!-- Can tell samraggi in the starting that my friendship with namespace is maybe slowly going to an end. And guess how much time i can keep myself from talking to her. Now see these profiles. Remember the food fest day. That was the same thing. -->

* First of all, it loads the .class file into memory.
* Then it verifies whether all byte code instructions are proper or not. If not, program execution is aborted.
* If the byte instructions are proper, then it does memory allocation.
* This memory is divided into five parts, called **"runtime data areas"**, which contains the data and results while running the program. 
    * **Method area**: Method area is the memory block which stores the class code, code of the variables, and code of the methods in the Java program.

    * **Heap**: This is the area where the objects are created. Whenever JVM loads a class, a method and a heap area are immediately created in it.

    <!-- This Java stacks is not fully understood. Do deeper analysis -->
    * **Java Stacks**: *Method code is stored on the Method area.* But while running a method, it needs some more memory to store the data and results. This memory is allocated on Java Stacks. 
    So, Java Stacks are memory areas where Java methods are executed. While executing methods, a separate frame will be created in the Java stack, where the method is executed. JVM uses a separate thread (or process) to execute each method. 

    <!-- What does exactly a memory area means -->
    * **Program Counter registers**: These are the registers(memory areas), which contain memory address of the instructions of the methods. No of methods is equal to the number of registers used.

    * **Native method stacks**: Like Java methods are executed on Java Stacks similarly, native methods(for ex: c/c++ functions) are executed on Native method Stacks. 
    To execute native methods, generally native method libraries(for ex: c/c++ header files) are required. 
    These header files are located and connected to JVM by a program, called Native method interface.

Generally, any language (like C/C++, Fortran, COBOL, etc.) will use either an interpreter or a compiler to translate the source code into a machine code. But in JVM, we got interpreter and JIT compiler both working at the same time on byte code to translate it into machine code. Now, the main question is why both are needed and how both work simultaneously? After loading the .class code into memory, JVM first of all identifies which code is to be left to interpreter and which one to JIT compiler so that the performance is better. The blocks of code allocated for JIT compiler are also called' hotspots. Thus, both the interpreter and JIT compiler will work simultaneously to translate the byte code into machine code.

**Q. What JIT compiler?**

A. JIT compiler is the part of JVM which increases the speed of execution of a Java program.

## Differences between C++ and Java
| C++      | Java          |
| --------- | ----------------- |
|Not purely Object-oriented| Purely Object-oriented|
|Pointers are available| We cannot create and use pointers|
|Allocating and deallocating memory is the responsibility of the programmer| It can be taken care of by the JVM|
|C++ has goto statement|does not have goto|
|Automatic casting is available|In some cases, implicit casting is available. Programmer should use casting wherever required|
|Multiple inheritence is available|It is not there in Java, but there are means to achieve it|
|Overator overloading is there|Operator overloading is omitted|
|#define, typedef and header files are available|These are not in Java, but there are means to achieve them|
|There are 3 access specifiers: public, private, and protected|Supports 4 access specifiers: public, private, protected, default|
|Both constructors and destructors|Only constructors are there. No detrcutors are available in Java|

## Parts of Java
Sun microsystems has divided Java into 3 parts- JAVA SE, EE, ME:-

1. **Java SE**: Standard Edition that contains core java classes. It is used to develop standard applets and applications. 

2. **Java EE**: It is the Java Enterprise Edition and it contains classes beyond the Java SE. In fact, we need Java SE in order to use many of the classes in Java EE. Java EE mainly concentrates on providing business solutions on a network.

3. **Java ME**: It stands for~Java Micro Edition. Java ME is for developers who develop code for portable devices, such as a PDA or a cellular phone. Code on these devices needs to be small in
siz€ and should take less memory.
<!-- PDA means Personal Digital Assistant -->
