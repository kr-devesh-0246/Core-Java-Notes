 # chapter 1: All about the networks

**Fact**: C/C++ are not opted for a network and Java is exclusively selected for a network, and especially Internet.

Network is simply the interconnection between two or more computers. It's prime purpose is resource sharing. 
But why? Because by sharing resources we can help better resource utilisation. 

*Note:* There is something like Client Server Architecture. I'll dive deep later.

Client--------------->Server: Request

Server--------------->Client: Response

## There are three Requirements for setting up network
1. **Hardware**: Computers and components like NIC, cables, modems, hubs,...
2. **Software**: Softwares which supports networking features, like Unix, Linux, ... So that data can be sent or recieved
3. **Protocol**: Standard procedure for regulating data transimission between computers. It specifies the way to identify
 the source and destination computers and establish a connection between them to recieve or send data. Ex:- TCP/IP, 
 UDP. *Protocol is the underlying feature of the software used on the network*

## What Comprises the Internet?
Internet could be defined as the network of all the computers existing on the earth. Including a network of 
computers that may be connected into the internet. So, It is also sometimes defined as the global network of all 
networks.

*Internet's Origin Story*
In 1969, DoD(US military defense department)
They got 4 computers which they connected with a cable and Unix was installed on them. Which made the first network
 on Earth. 
It was called **ARPANET**(Advanced Research Project Agency Network).

Later on, NSFNet(National Science Foundation) encouraged individual users to get connected into this network(ARPANET). 
But the major issue was the huge length of cables that the public user required to connect. Say from India.

So, this was solved by using the already available cable of telephone companies like AT&T and British Telecom. 

Today, this network has trillions of computers connected with each other.

## Intranet and Extranet concept
**Intranet**- A network of computers within an organization is called Intranet. 

**Extranet**- External network connecting an organization's network with that of another organization is called Extranet.

**VAN(Value added Network)** // We will dive deep later.

*Left for making Notes later(TopicName- How does the Internet function?)*

## Software Development for Internet 
**C/C++ perspective**
Suppose we write a C program with name x.c
This x.c file contains source code. When we compile this, we get x.obj file that contains machine language code(Which is just equal to the source code in x.c). 
*Internals*
x.obj contains the first statement to include a header file, like <stdio.h>. When we run the program, C compiler goes to the C standard library(found in tc/lib) and searches for the header file there. When the header file is found. It copies the entire into the C program. 
Say you wrote 10 lines of code and <stdio.h> contains 200 lines then the total size of file will be 210 lines. This file is also called x.exe file.
This x.exe is the full-fledged file that contains entire program.

x.c -> x.obj -> x.exe -> Program output

This x.exe file depends on X processor and Y Operating system. If we generate x.exe on Pentium processor, that that x.exe file contains machine language instructions understandable to Pentium only .For this reason every operating system stores the data and instructions in different formats. Hence, C/C++ are system/platform dependent languages.
Note:- There is a lot more about instruction formats. 

Now, we know that Internet is a global network of all the computers. So there will be different types of computers with different processors and different operating systems. So if a software is developed in c/c++ cannot run those file due to system dependency. Therefore we needed Java.


In java, a file is a x.java file. It's first compiled to x.class file using javac compiler. 

**Q. What is inside this .class file?**

***Ans***. The Java people coined a group of instructions to express any operation. These instructions are called byte code instructions because the size of each instruction is 1 byte exactly. There are fixed number of byte code instructions, around 200. 

But this java file is not understandable by microprocessor, neither can it execute them. These are meant for JVM. JVM converts them into machine code. JVM is crucial bcs it has to first identify the processor and operating system used in the computer system and convert them accordingly.

Note:- JVM is a program, not a machine. It is system dependent.

x.java -> x.class -> JVM -> Program output

***Q***. What is the difference between an executable file and a .class file?

***Ans***. .exe file contains machine language instructions for the microprocessor and is system dependent. .class file contains byte code instructions for the JVM and is system independent.

## Security threats when a data is sent over the internet
### 1. **Eavesdropping**
Reading others data illegally on Internet. Solution is encryption and decryption. 
### 2. **Tampering**
Not only reading other's data but also modify it. Solution is encryption and decryption. 
### 3. **Impersonation**
A person disguising himself as another person on Internet. Many people hide their original identity and act as somebody else to make transactions. The Solution is *digital signature*, which is a file that contains personal identification information in an encrypted format. Digital signature can be created using Java technology.
### 4. **Virus**
A program that can potentially cause harm to the data, software, and hardware components of the computer system. 
Most prone format: .exe, .doc, audio, and video files.
Least prone format: Virus can not spread with a .txt file
In a .class file, Even if somebody tries to insert a virus code into .class file, JVM can verify its  presence before running the program and abort the .class file's execution.

All of the above Security threats can be managed using Java.
